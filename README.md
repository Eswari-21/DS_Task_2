Petal Length: 1.0 cm to 6.9 cm

Petal Width: 0.1 cm to 2.5 cm

## Data Distribution
### Histograms & KDEs:

Petal Length and Petal Width: Approximately normal distribution

Sepal Length: Slight right skew

Sepal Width: Bimodal distribution

### Box Plots:

Setosa: Smaller measurements with minimal variability

Versicolor: Moderate measurements with moderate variability

Virginica: Larger measurements with higher variability

## Correlation Analysis
### Strong Positive Correlations:

Petal Length & Petal Width: 0.96

Sepal Length & Petal Length: 0.87

Sepal Length & Petal Width: 0.96

### Weak Negative Correlations:

Sepal Width with Sepal Length, Petal Length, and Petal Width: Around -0.37

## Visualizations
Pairplot: Displays relationships between numerical features, color-coded by species.

Histograms: Show the distribution of each numerical feature.

Box Plots: Highlight the spread and central tendency of each feature.

## Conclusion
The Iris dataset exhibits distinct patterns among species, with petal dimensions offering clearer separation than sepal dimensions. These insights are foundational for further statistical analysis or machine learning modeling.
